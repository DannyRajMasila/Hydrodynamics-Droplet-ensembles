# Hydrodynamics-droplet-ensembles

Contains the codes for the manuscript titled 'On the role of hydrodynamics in the self assembly of droplet ensembles'
Authors: Danny Raj M, Abeynaya G, Raghunathan R

## Case 1: Long range 
Codes based on the model in Shen et al (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.201600012) for droplet pattern formation. Primary file to run: Main.m

## Case 2: Short range
Codes based on the model in Danny et al (http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10404-014-1336-8) for droplet pattern formation and use in GA. Contains code for standalone testing [Primary file to run: MultiAgentSim_droplets_patternformation.m] and for design using GA [Primary file to run: GA_ParticleAssembly.m].
